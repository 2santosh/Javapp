Java AWT Tutorial
Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop GUI or window-based applications in java.
It components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT is heavywright i.e. its components are using the resources of OS.
it's package provides classes for QWT api such as TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc.


AWT packages
it's huge! it consists of 12 packages of 370 classes (Swing is even bigger, with 18 packages of 737 classes  as of JDK 8). Fortunately,only 2 packages-java.awt and java.awt.event-are commonly-used.

The java.awt package contains the core AWT graphics classes:
1. GUI component classes, such as Button, textField, and Label

Java Swing Tutorial
Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation classes(JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. it is built on the top of awt(Abstract windowing toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
it's provides javax.swing package for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMEnu, JColorChooser etc.



Jlabel
example:

import javax.swing.JLabel;
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class ExampleJLable{
public static void main(string[] args){

JLabel lable = new JLable("A very simpler text lable);

JFrame frame = new JFrame;
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
frame.getContentPane().add(label);
frame.pack();
frame.setVisble(true);
}
}
